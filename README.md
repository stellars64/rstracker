# rstracker
Simple XP tracker for Runescape. (And eventually, OSRS as well.)

This is very much a WIP, and is being created for learning purposes.

Access this running live at https://www.trashgang.net

Enter in a player's username in one of the textboxes. After clicking
enter, you should see that player's skills in Runescape, and, if 
this player has been looked up previously on the site, a line chart!

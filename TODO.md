I am passing both userdata and newuserdata to rstracker.html -- I need to switch everything to newuserdata,
but rename newuserdata to userdata

In multiple places, I am setting the form elements of id=user-info-form and submitting. I need to create a js fn
that takes in parameters or something, to avoid repetition

I recently implemented timescale. So there are issues related to that
One is that changing the timescale assumes 2 users are currently being displayed, I need to change that. Changing
the timescale submits the user-info-form in rstracker.html
